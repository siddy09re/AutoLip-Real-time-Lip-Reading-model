# AutoLip-Real-time-Lip-Reading-model
AutoLip uses Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for real-time lip reading, aiding communication for deaf individuals and in noisy settings. It also serves security and law enforcement. CNNs extract spatial lip features, while RNNs capture temporal lip movement, enabling real-time sentence-level predictions
